V = from house to exam center
W = back

known things:
1.contest timings
2.wormhole timings

(15,21), (5,10), and (7,25)

vtime = 4,14,25,2 

wtime = 13,21

sort vtime and wtime and contest timings(by diif)

vtime = 2,4,14,25             2,4,14,25  13,21

wtime = 13,21

contests = [(5,10),(15,21),(7,25)]
---
strategies:
1. find combinations of wormhole times nd check if there is a contest in 
	between them

2. start finding smallest gap and then find is there a contest in between them

 (4,13) -9
 
 mini prob: finding lowest interwal?
 
 broot approach:
  find all pairs of wormholes and check if there is a contest 
  and then select the lowest interwal.
